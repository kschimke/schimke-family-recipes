Ingredients:

- Unbleached all purpose flour, 1 3/4 cups
- Baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon
- Unsalted butter, 14 tablespoons
- Granulated sugar, 1/4 cup
- Packed dark brown sugar, 1 cup
- Salt, 3/4 teaspoon
- Vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons
- Large egg, 1
- Large egg yolk, 1
- Semisweet chocolate chips, 1 cup

Cookware:

- Silicon baking sheet, 2
- Baking sheet, 2
- Medium bowl, 1
- 10-inch skillet, 1
- Mixing bowl or stand mixer, 1

Steps:

- Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375°F.
- Line 2 large baking sheets with silicon baking sheets. Whisk flour and baking soda together in medium bowl; set aside.
- Heat 10 tablespoons butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted (about 1-2 minutes).
- Once melted, continue to cook while continuously swirling the pan until the butter is a dark brown color and has a nutty aroma (about 1-3 minutes).
- Once it’s reached this point, pour butter immediately into a stand mixer (or mixing bowl) and add remaining 4 tablespoons butter beating until all the butter is melted and combined.
- To this mixture add sugar, salt, vanilla egg and egg yolk beating until smooth with no lumps.
- Let mixture stand 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat process of resting and whisking 2 more times until mixture is thick, smooth and shiny.
- Gently fold in flour mixture until just combined.
- Stir in chocolate chips and nuts if using then stir once more to ensure no flour pockets remain.
- Using a cookie scoop, combine 2 scoops (about 3 tablespoons of dough) and roll into a ball placing on the prepared baking sheet 2 inches apart.
- Bake cookies 1 tray at a time for 5 minutes, rotate tray and cook for another 5-7 minutes (until edges are lightly browned but center is soft).
- Cool on a wire cooling rack until they are firm enough to pick up (about 5-10 minutes) then repeat the above step with second tray of cookies.
